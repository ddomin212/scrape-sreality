# Sreality scraper

A web app that scrapes the first 500 postings from [sreality](sreality.cz) and saves them in a local PostgreSQL database. It also displays said listings in a very simple webapp on localhost:8080

the app is meant to be run with `docker compose up`, to actually run the local PostgreSQL database
